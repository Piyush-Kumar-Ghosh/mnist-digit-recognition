# 🧠 MNIST Digit Recognition

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits.  
This repo includes a clean, well-documented Jupyter Notebook that walks through:

- Data preprocessing
- CNN architecture (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy/loss visualization
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Sample prediction plots

🔍 The notebook is self-contained and beginner-friendly — perfect for showcasing basic deep learning concepts.
